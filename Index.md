### About me

My name is Hessah. I graduated in 2008 with a degree in Geography from Riydah University for womwem, Saudi Arabia. I am currently
studying Master of science in GIs at University of Leeds.
Before coming to Leeds my knowledge in computer was using the operator system , during this cours I have leaned and gained new
skills and experience in programming as python which made me more confident in using softwares through my studying.
