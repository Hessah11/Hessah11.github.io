## Assignment 1: Agent Based Modelling
During the practical sesstions in programming for GIS module, I have created an agent-based model (ABM). An ABM 
is an iterative model which contains agents that are doing a number of activities repeatedly within an environment .
These agents wouid stop after a set number of iterations or when they reach a stopping condition.

### Created model features
The model created represents a number of agents that are interacting with the environment and each other.
The code created has the following characteristics:
  * Creates agents in space by reading data from the web.
  * Creates an environment by reading data from a file.
  * Makes agents interact with the environment in a random order.
  * Gets the agents to share resources.
  * Animates the agents interactions within a GUI.
