### About me

My name is Hessah. I graduated in 2008 with a degree in Geography from Riydah University for women, Saudi Arabia. I am currently studying Master of science in GIs at University of Leeds.
Before coming to Leeds my knowledge in computers was limited to using the operating system, Microsoft Office and some other basic tools. During my short time on the GIS MSc program, I have gained new
skills and experience in different tools such as ArcGIS and programming using Python which made me more confident in using softwares through my studies.
